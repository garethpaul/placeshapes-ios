# Location-Independent Make Gates

status: completed

## Context

The dependency-free structural checker passes from the repository root and by
direct absolute script path, but an absolute Makefile invocation from another
working directory still resolves `scripts/check-baseline.py` against the
caller. Shared automation should use every standard alias without changing its
own directory.

## Requirements

- Derive an override-protected repository root from the Makefile location.
- Invoke the structural checker by its rooted path for `lint`, `test`, `build`,
  `verify`, and `check` without changing alias behavior.
- Preserve polygon validation contracts, credential-free signing metadata,
  workflow policy, source fixtures, and the no-Xcode structural boundary.
- Statically reject caller-relative or caller-overridable checker execution.
- Record completed repository-root and external-Makefile verification.

## Scope Boundaries

- Do not change Swift, XCTest, Xcode project, plist, workspace, asset catalog,
  workflow, signing, dependency, coordinate, gesture, MapKit, or privacy data.
- Do not claim a Linux-hosted Xcode build, simulator, or XCTest result.
- Do not weaken the structural checker or polygon draft contracts.

## Implementation Units

1. Root the Makefile's checker recipe while preserving every existing alias.
2. Extend `scripts/check-baseline.py` to require the rooted recipe, this plan,
   completed evidence, and maintenance documentation.
3. Document the external invocation contract in `README.md` and `CHANGES.md`.

## Verification Plan

- Run every standard alias from the repository root and through the absolute
  Makefile path from `/tmp`, including a caller-supplied root override.
- Compile the checker outside the repository and parse workflow YAML, plists,
  workspace/scheme XML, and README SVG.
- Run isolated hostile mutations over rooted execution and completed evidence.
- Audit intended paths, unchanged implementation/project surfaces, whitespace,
  generated artifacts, personal coordinates, and secret-like data.

## Work Completed

The Makefile now derives an override-protected absolute repository root from
its own location and invokes the dependency-free structural checker through
that root. Every existing alias still resolves to the same checker, and no
Swift, XCTest, Xcode project, plist, workspace, asset, workflow, signing,
dependency, coordinate, gesture, MapKit, or privacy surface changed.

## Verification Completed

- `make lint`, `make test`, `make build`, `make verify`, `make check`, and
  `make static-check` passed from the repository root.
- Every alias passed from `/tmp` through the repository's absolute Makefile
  path.
- External `make check` passed with caller-supplied `REPO_ROOT=/tmp`, confirming
  command-line variables cannot redirect checker execution.
- `python3 -m py_compile scripts/check-baseline.py` passed with bytecode routed
  outside the repository; workflow YAML, all three plists,
  workspace/scheme XML, and README SVG parsed successfully.
- Nine isolated hostile mutations were rejected across root derivation,
  override resistance, checker invocation, completed evidence, README, and
  change-history contracts.
